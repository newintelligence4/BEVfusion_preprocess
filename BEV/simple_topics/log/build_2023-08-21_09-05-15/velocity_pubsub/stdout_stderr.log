CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:25 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findc_auto_vehicle_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "c_auto_vehicle_msgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "c_auto_vehicle_msgs" with any of the following names:

    c_auto_vehicle_msgsConfig.cmake
    c_auto_vehicle_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "c_auto_vehicle_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "c_auto_vehicle_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "c_auto_vehicle_msgs" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
